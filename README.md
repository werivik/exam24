# Crazy Plant Lady 

## Description

This is a blogg website with focus on plants. The users can read all the blogg posts on the website, but only the admin can delete-, add new- and change posts. The admin login page can be accessed through clicking on the Crazy Plant Lady female face profile picture and login in using a email and password assigned to the admin. 

The design inspiration comes from the word play "Crazy Cat Lady", whcih could be associated with: 

- Vintage/"Ugly" wallpaper

To make it also appealing for users to look at, the design has a modern twist, while still keeping some "vintage" aspects.
